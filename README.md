# FailDos
Final project for CS131 - FAILDOS

**must be run through DOSBox**

# Dependencies
* [Download the appropriate version of DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) for your environment.

# Running
This example was written for a Linux environment and may need to be adapted slightly to fit your needs.

Start DOSBox and enter the following commands:

    Z:\>mount c: ~/<path to folder containing executable>/
    Z:\>c:
    C:\>FAILDOS.EXE

For example, if you download FAILDOS.EXE to ~/Downloads, the `mount` command will make ~/Downloads your root (c:) directory:

    Z:\>mount c: ~/Downloads/
    Z:\>c:
    C:\>FAILDOS.EXE
